# üõ†Ô∏è PyExecGo Builder

Welcome to the **PyExecGo Builder**!

## What is PyExecGo?

**PyExecGo** is a lightweight solution that allows you to run Python scripts on any system **without requiring Python** to be installed. It bundles a portable version of Python along with an open-source Go executable, making it simple and user-friendly.

## üöÄ Why Use the Builder?

The **PyExecGo Builder** streamlines the setup process for creating your own PyExecGo executable. Here‚Äôs why you should use it:

- **No Go Installation Needed**: You don‚Äôt need to have Go installed on your system to use this builder. Just run the tool and let it handle the rest!
- **Automatic Setup**: The builder automates the setup process, saving you time and effort.
- **Open Source**: Like the main project, the builder is open source. You can trust the code and even contribute to it!

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Builder

1. **Download the Builder**: Get the latest release of the builder from our [releases page](https://github.com/PyExecGo-Project/PyExecGo-Builder/releases).
2. **Run the Builder**: Simply execute the builder and follow the prompts. It will guide you through the necessary steps to package your Python scripts.
3. **Distribute Your Package**: Once the builder has finished, you‚Äôll have a package ready to run on any machine without needing Python installed!

### üõ†Ô∏è Build the Builder Yourself

If you prefer to build the builder yourself, it's straightforward! Just clone this repository and run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
go build main.go
```

This will create the builder executable that you can use just like the pre-built version.
